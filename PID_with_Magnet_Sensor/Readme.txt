This program uses a falcon motor and magnetic sensor.

Press A to enable Percent output mode and have joystick control (Axis 0) control the motor
Press X to enable PID and move to a left setpoint
Press B to enable PID and to move to a right setpoint
Press Start to reset the encoder to 0

If the magnetic sensor is triggered it will reset the encoder, simulating a soft limit/reset

This program also allows the user to change P,I,D and Closed loop max output via the dashboard.
You can use this program to quickly and easily tune your PID loops and determine your motors max output
